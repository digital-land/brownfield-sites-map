In principle infilling development within BUAB's is acceptable provided it is of an appropriate nature and scale. The site has therefore been assessed as Developable 6-10 years subject to the parking issue being resolved as part of subsequent applications. This may be through a smaller scheme than the 9 proposed for this application. The proximity of this site to the Conservation Area would mean that any design on this site would need to be designed sensitively and the loss of community facilities and any mitigation would also need to be reconsidered as part of any future application,9670448e16b3e66762311f14f2455c38f83f8def1184dbac11afff475513fad4,Horsham District Council
